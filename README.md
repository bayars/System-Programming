# System Programming

I shared the system programming lectures notes and exams. All code wrote c so that compiled with gcc. You can compile with that way:

```
gcc <ProgramName> -o out -pthread 
```

Additionally, I added my teacher notes in the directories but the notes in Turkish language. You can investigate the codes in the notes.
